# Balloon-Game
This project is part of a group of Unity Engine built Oculus Rift VR games for stroke patient rehabilitation. 
-----
The objective of the game is for the player to pop balloons by poking them with his or her hands. 
Patients develop hand-eye coordination and practice arm extension movements needed for day-to-day activities.
