# Balloon-Game
This project is part of a group of Unity Engine built Oculus Rift VR games for stroke patient rehabilitation. 
-----
The objective of the game is for the player to pop balloons by poking them with his or her hands. 
Patients develop hand-eye coordination and practice arm extension movements needed for day-to-day activities.
-----

Once the player starts the game they begin a series of levels progressing in difficulty.

Each level has two balloon that can only be popped with a specific hand (yellow with left and blue with right)
The color on the needle the player is holding is the designation for that and it never swaps.

Once a player has popped a balloon the needle will disappear and the user will need to "reload" by bring their hands to their chest.
This is to prevent people form just holding their hands out and getting free points as we want this game to be excercise for patients.
This will give the extending movement they need to practice.
